The rationale for the Over Amplification Rate measure Since out-of-frame TCR/BCR rearrangements do not form a functional receptor, they are not subjected to any specific clonal expansions and selection (Murugan et al., 2012). Being a passenger genomic variation, they change their initial (recombinational) clonal frequencies just randomly following the frequency changes of the second functional (in-frame) TCR/BCR allele present in the same T/B cell clone. According to the TCR/BCR loci rearrangement mechanism, the formation of in-frame and out-of-frame allele combinations in the same cell is also a stochastic and independent process in terms of V- and J-genes frequency. It leads to the conclusion that V- and J-gene frequencies among out-of-frame rearrangements must be sufficiently stable and must be equal to the initial recombination frequencies despite repertoire changes caused by various immune challenges (Figure 1). Thus, reproducible deviation of out-of-frame V- and J-gene frequencies (for the same multiplex PCR primer set) from the initial recombinational frequencies observed in the sequenced repertoire dataset is a result of artificial aberration caused by PCR amplification rather than immune repertoire evolution. Thus out-of-frame clonotypes can be considered a natural calibrator that can be used to measure amplification bias and quantitatively correct immune repertoire data.
